# Directory management

Conventions for directory and relevant data file management.

### Version history

- Create a directory called `archive` for every level where there are files that will have several versions
- When a file gets a new version you append `v$(version number)` to it and move it to the `archive/` directory on the same level
  *Example: `archive/testFile_2023-01-23_v1`*
